## Get Started For Development
### Install Dependencies
   * Windows:
      * Install **cmake**
      * Install the latest C++ compiler with **Visual Studio**.
      * Install **Qt6** or Qt5 (Qt6 is recommended). We recommend to [download the official Installer of **Qt Creator**](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools). Alternatively, to install Qt from command line using **aqt**, see our [Azure Pipeline configuration](https://github.com/Necktschnagge/cmake-qt-prototype/blob/main/azure-pipelines.yml) (not recommended for Desktop Development).
      * Remark: You may use the MinGW toolchain shipped with the Qt Creator IDE. However we do not recommend this. Instead make sure that you have installed the MSVC 2019 component of your selected Qt version. For this use Qt Maintenance Tool.
      * Check that system environment variables are set to enable cmake to find Qt when running `*--create-project.[ps1|sh|bat]` script at later steps, e.g.:
         * `QT_DIR = C:\Qt`
         * `PATH = C:\Qt\6.5.0\msvc2019_64\bin;...`
   * Linux:
      * Install cmake, gcc/g++, Qt (Qt6 is recommended, Qt5 is supported)
      * Installing Qt [using the official Installer of **Qt Creator**](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools) is recommended.
      * Alternatively, you may use the system's package manager:
          * for Qt5 (e.g. *Ubuntu 20.04*) run
            
            `apt-get install build-essential cmake qtbase5-dev libqt5svg5-dev`
          * for Qt6 (e.g. *Ubuntu 22.04*) run
          
            `apt-get install build-essential cmake libgl1-mesa-dev qt6-base-dev libqt6svg6-dev`
      * See our [Azure Pipeline configuration](https://github.com/Necktschnagge/cmake-qt-prototype/blob/main/azure-pipelines.yml) for details.
   * MacOS:
      * *See instructions for Linux. You may use clang instead of g++.*
### Setup Local Repository
   * Clone this repository.
   * `cd` into directory `script/
   * Run `*-clean-init.[ps1|sh|bat]` to update (in particular *initialize*) the git submodules
   * Run `*--create-project.[ps1|sh|bat]` to create a project for your custom toolchain
   * Run `*-build.[ps1|sh|bat]` to build your entire CMake Project, including multiple targets
   
   * On Windows you may use `wos-win-open-sln.ps1` to open your project in Visual Studio
   * You may use Qt Creator to open a cmake project instead of running `*--create-project.[ps1|sh|bat]` scripts and following.

### Qt6 versus Qt5
   * We recommend using the latest version **Qt6**. However we support Qt5 as well.
   * To build your project with Qt5, use the flag `-DUSE_QT6:BOOL=FALSE` for creating projects with cmake instead of just running script `*--create-project.[ps1|sh|bat]`. The complete command to create a project using Qt5 is
```
cmake -S . -B ./build/ -DUSE_QT6:BOOL=FALSE
```
   * When opening a cmake project with Qt Creator, you may select your toolchain while clicking through the project generation assistant.
